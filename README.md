# Benchmarkig phylogenetic workflows for E.coli K12 whole genome
## Summary
Nowadays it is more than obvious that genomic epidemiology is of great importance to achieve public health. Phylogenetic workflow is the foundation and first step for understanding whole genome sequence data from bacterial populations. The methods for phylogenetic reconstruction is complex and are often based of usability, rather than the ability to answer the biological question. Therefore it is desirable to search the golden method for phylogenetic workflows. Hitherto simulating of genomes is considered the most appropriate approach to benchmark phylogenetic workflows and eventually conclude the golden method.
